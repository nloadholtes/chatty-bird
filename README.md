# chatty-bird

An app to post things to twitter automatically

## Installation

Clone this repo, and run `./run.sh <name-of-csv-containing-tweets>`

## Usage

To make things easier on future me, this is running in a docker container.

It can also be run from the command line with `lein run` although lein
gives me troubles with the environment vars.
